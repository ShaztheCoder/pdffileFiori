Important Notes:
Replace com/pdfextract in all paths with your actual application namespace
The _parseExtractedText function needs to be implemented based on your PDF structure
Add appropriate error handling and validation
Test the application thoroughly with different PDF files
Consider adding loading indicators for better user experience
Common Issues and Solutions:
If you get CORS errors:
Add appropriate security headers in your index.html
Configure your web server to allow necessary headers
If PDF.js worker is not loading:
Verify the worker path is correct
Check if the file is accessible via the browser
If PDF extraction is slow:
Consider adding a loading indicator
Process pages in smaller batches
Optimize the parsing logic
Memory management:
Clean up PDF objects after processing
Handle large files appropriately
This setup provides a foundation for PDF processing in your Fiori application. You can enhance it further based on your specific requirements.
