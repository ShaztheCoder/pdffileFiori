To use this application, you'll need to:
Include the pdf.js library in your project (you can download it from Mozilla's GitHub repository)
Create an OData service with these entities:
SalesOrderHeaderSet
SalesOrderItemSet
The application flow:
User selects a PDF file using the FileUploader
The PDF is processed using pdf.js library
Text is extracted and parsed into a structured format
Data is displayed in a table for review
User can save the extracted data to the backend using OData service
Important notes:
1. The _parseExtractedText function needs to be implemented according to your PDF structure. You'll need to add logic to identify and extract the relevant information based on your specific PDF layout.
You'll need to modify the OData service path in the manifest.json to match your backend service.
The data structure should match your backend entities.
Error handling and validation should be added based on your requirements.
You might want to add loading indicators and additional error handling for better user experience.
To enhance this application, you could:
Add preview functionality for the PDF
Add validation before saving
Add the ability to edit extracted data before saving
Add a status indicator for the extraction process
Implement batch processing for multiple PDFs
Remember to adjust the parsing logic based on your PDF structure and add appropriate error handling and validation according to your business requirements.
